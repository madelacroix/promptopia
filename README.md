A fullstack project that I did to learn Nextjs13. Learned a lot of new and familiar concepts. Next13 has a new (and arguably better) way that it structures its folders. Also got to learn more about serverless route handlers. Now I'm learning about how to use mongodb in local using robomongo and a linux virtual machine.

### Technologies used:

- Next.js 13
- MongoDB Cloud Atlas
- Node.js
- TailwindCSS
